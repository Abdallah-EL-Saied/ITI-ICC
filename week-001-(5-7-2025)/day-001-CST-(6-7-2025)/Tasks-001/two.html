	<h2>Exercise 1: "About Me" Page</h2>
	<p>Create a page named <a href="">aboutme.html</a> that describes you. (You can use DreamWeaver or Notepad++). On your page, include some or all of the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
		<li>TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT - TEXT</li>
	</ul>

	<p>(You may be tempted to spend all 50 of your minutes on this part of the lab. But try to keep the page somewhat short so that you can attempt some of the other exercises.)</p>
	<p>	<p>(You may be tempted to spend all 50 of your minutes on this part of the lab. But try to keep the page somewhat short so that you can attempt some of the other exercises.)</p>
	<p>Write your page using valid XHTML 1.1. Include a link from your page to the W3C XHTML Validator, using the following image and linking to the following site:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>image:<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools</a></li>
		<li>site:<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>The next task will be to write a stylesheet for your page, so also include a link to the W3C CSS Validator, using the following image and linking to the following site:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>image:<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools</a></li>
		<li>site:<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html">w3schools</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>For example, the following is the About Me page describes textbook coauthor Victoria Kirst (between, but not including, the thick black lines):</p>
